Talks you through what to do

call my local police force (based on location); they give me a reference, which I enter into the app and then use to submit the details (and photos) of the stolen items.

â€¦get a crime number (report GUID)

Type your crime number in here, identify which items have been stolen, select the items, submit my report.

Send to server, which emails the appropriate police force (based on location of report) with a link to Nabbd. They (at some point) come to the site, log in as "copper" and "kettle", link has the crime number in, they see the report.

They click to download it in appropriate format for their own report. Not enough bobbies out on the beat.

Police commissioner can then log in and say "how are our crime stats looking?" - summary statistics of all of the crimes that have occurred.

I can then log in to a web site to see these items, based on the reference; the police can see an overview of all reported burglaries; the police can also see a summary of the number of reported crimes (as per the data.gov.uk reports).
